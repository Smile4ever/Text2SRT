Requirements
------------
- Any Linux distribution
- Gambas 3:
-- gambas-ide gambas3-gb-net gambas3-gb-net-curl gambas3-gb-net-smtp
- ffmpeg or libav-tools (avconv)
- git
- libnotify
- xdg-utils
- pkill (for pause functionality)

Recommended players:
* mpv
* VLC Media Player

Other players can be used too, but only these two support the pause mode for now.

Installation
------------
If you have not installed gambas3-ide, do it now using your packaging manager. The minimum requirement is v3.0. FFmpeg or libav-tools is required too. Any recent version (>2011) will do.

- cd
- git clone https://github.com/Smile4ever/Text2SRT.git
- Open Gambas3 from your Applications menu
- Open the project Text2SRT from your home folder
- Press F5 (run)

There is no desktop file yet to integrate with your system. This is on the TODO.
