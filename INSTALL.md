== Requirements ==
- Any Linux distribution
- gambas3-ide (and it's dependencies)
- ffmpeg
- git
- libnotify

Recommended:
* VLC Media Player (or any video player that supports SRT subtitles)

== Installation ==
If you have not installed gambas3-ide, do it now using your packaging manager. The minimum requirement is v3.0. FFmpeg is required too. Any recent version (>2011) will do.

- cd
- git clone https://github.com/Smile4ever/Text2SRT.git
- Open Gambas3 from your Applications menu
- Open the project Text2SRT from your home folder
- Press F5 (run)

There is no desktop file yet to integrate with your system. This is on the TODO.
