<h1>Filename</h1>
<p>The music videos should be named correctly to allow for automatic fetching of lyrics.</p>
<p>Valid file names are:
<ul>
	<li>Artist - Title (year of release) -&gt; "Steve Allen - Letter From My Heart (1984)"</li>
    <li>Artist - Title - > Steve Allen - Letter From My Heart</li>
    <li>Artist - Title (anything): the information between parenthesis is discarded</li>
    <li>Artist - Title: also works without spaces before and after the hyphen</li>
</ul>
Wrong file names:
<ul>
    <li>Title - Artist
    <li>File names that contain two hyphens, Like "Artist - Title - Album name".
</ul>
There is one exception: artist names that contain a hyphen are valid. For example "A-ha - Stay On These Roads".
