<h1>Recording</h1>
<p>The recording step is step 3 where you generate the SRT subtitle. This step is automatically started after opening a video file (step 2).</p>
<p>When you hear the beginning of a sentence, click "Add line". A sentence (line) from the left textbox will be added to the right textbox with time information. When there is a pause for a while, you can press Add pause. This will finish the current line, so that there are no subtitles when there is a (textual) pause in the audio.</p>
<p>The result (SRT output) will appear in the right textbox. This will become the subtitle after saving it (step 4).</p>
